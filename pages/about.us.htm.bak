		<h1>More about us</h1>
		
		<p>We are an Australian company, made in 2022. Our mission is to make the best options available towards smoothies and not effect the environment while doing so. We have kept in mind any of our customer's possible needs and allergies, which is why we have an assortment of ingredients!</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>To make it fair to all for our customers, we have chosen to keep all dairy free alternatives the same price as as their originals.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Do you sit and work out which option is more affordable based on sizes? We do too! Which is why we decided to add it to our page! Part of having a good relationship with our customers is to be transparent and open about this stuff. Feel free to do the maths yourself, but to anyone who just wants the answer, here it is!</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Tester - 200ml for $4</li>
			<li>Tester - 50ml for $1</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Small - 400ml for $6</li>
			<li>Small - 66.6666666667ml for $1</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Medium - 600ml for $8</li>
			<li>Medium - 75ml for $1</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Large - 800ml for $10</li>
			<li>Large - 80ml for $1</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>You get the above results by dividing the milliliters by the price, then you are left with how many milliliters would be in a dollar's worth of that size.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<ul>
			<li>200ml to 400ml is a 100% increase</li>
			<li>$4 to $6 is a 50% increase</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>400ml to 600ml is a 50% increase</li>
			<li>$6 to $8 is a 33.33% increase</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>600ml to 800ml is a 33.33% increase</li>
			<li>$8 to $10 is a 25% increase</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This shows that, for example with the first numbers, the size is doubling but the price is only going up by half.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>You will see when your order arrives that we have chosen to go with recycled plastic cups, accompanied by paper straws and packaging. Even though we have designs ready for paper cups, we chose to go with plastic as it was our cheapest option. So we decided that a good middle ground was to use an easy to recycle material, which had the bonus option of already being recycled. When we get enough funds, we will be looking at opening a store, as well as adding the option to buy reusable and paper cups, as well as possibly some metal straws and some cotton bags for transport. Let us know of any other suggestions by filling out a Questions form.</p>
