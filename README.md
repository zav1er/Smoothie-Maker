# Smoothie-Maker

This website is for educational purposes only, this is not a real and functioning website. This was made as an assessment to be graded. 

This website is based on an idea of being able to create your own custom smoothies and get the delivered. The order form does not have the full details needed for a proper order to make it simpler for my teachers to mark. This website includes an option to give your drink its own custom name. It also has both order and question submition pages to let the viewer know that thier input has been recognised. The contact email and number were made up, but still do not contact them for fun as I have no control over who that is. Keep in mind this is a simple website with simple functions and was not made for actual use, so there may be things that could be improved that i just do not have the knowledge for yet.

I hope you find no errors and i hope it works well on your side. I guess you can feel free to play around with the code if that is even allowed, but this is still my website, so please do not say the images or idea was yours. The icons came from icons 8, some i modified but the base is still the same.
